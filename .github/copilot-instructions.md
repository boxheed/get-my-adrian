# AI Coding Agent Instructions for `get-my-adrian`

## Overview
This repository currently lacks detailed documentation about its purpose, architecture, and workflows. The following instructions aim to guide AI coding agents in contributing effectively to this project.

## Key Directories and Files
- **`README.md`**: Currently empty. This file should ideally describe the project's purpose, setup instructions, and usage examples.
- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**: This file provides guidance for AI agents.

## Project Structure
The repository structure is minimal. Additional context about the project's architecture, components, and workflows is needed to provide more specific guidance.

## Recommendations for AI Contributions
1. **Documentation**:
   - Populate the `README.md` with a clear project description, setup instructions, and usage examples.
   - Add comments to code files to explain their purpose and functionality.

2. **Code Patterns**:
   - Follow standard conventions for the programming language(s) used in this repository (not yet identified).
   - Ensure code is modular, readable, and well-documented.

3. **Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for all new functionality.
   - Use a consistent testing framework (to be determined based on the project's language).

4. **Integration**:
   - Identify and document any external dependencies or APIs used by the project.
   - Ensure compatibility with existing components.

## Next Steps
- Clarify the project's purpose and goals.
- Define coding standards and workflows.
- Provide examples of existing patterns or conventions to follow.
